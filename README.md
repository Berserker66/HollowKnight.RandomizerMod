# Randomizer 3

Randomizer 3 expands on previous versions of the Hollow Knight randomizer by allowing you to randomize more items than ever before and, for the first time, to randomize area or room transitions. Details on all of the various settings follow:

## Restrictions

These settings control which difficult skips the randomizer may require. If you are not familiar with these skips, especially as they are used in speedrunning, you are advised to turn them off.

## Quality of Life

- Salubra Notches: automatically gives you each Salubra charm notch upon acquiring the required number of charms
- Lemm Sell All: sell all relics at once to Lemm by talking to him from the right
- Jiji Hints: trade a rancid egg for information on which areas contain which items. Note that this shop uses a broader area definition than that used for area rando
- Pleasure House Geo: places a 1500 geo pickup in the Pleasure House hot spring
- Early Geo: start the game with 300 geo.

## Randomization

These settings control which items are randomized. The first four settings are always on.
- Dreamers: Lurien, Monomon, Herrah, and World Sense. World Sense is the Black Egg Temple pickup to view your completion percentage
- Skills: all spells, nail arts, and movement abilities, excluding the Awoken Dream Nail, which is never randomized
- Charms
- Keys: all key objects, as well as King's Brand, Godtuner, and Collector's Map
- Mask Shards
- Vessel Fragments
- Pale Ore
- Charm Notches
- Rancid Eggs
- Relics: All wanderers journals, hallownest seals, king's idols, and arcane eggs.
- Longest Check: replaces the following locations with arcane eggs: - Essence pickups beyond 900 essence, Grub pickups beyond 23 grubs, King Fragment, Colosseum items, Grey Mourner Mask Shard, Grimm charm notch
- Create spoiler log

## Additional features

There are three logs created in the save directory to help you with your playthrough.
- Tracker Log: this log continuously records item locations, transition connections, and hints as you discover them.
- Helper Log: this log computes which locations/transitions are accessible with your current equipment.
- Spoiler Log: this log lists the exact locations of every randomized item and/or transition.

## Area/Room randomizer

- Area randomizer randomizes items and connections between areas, which are understood to be any region of the game with a name which appears as onscreen text, excluding dream areas, trams, and elevators.
- Room randomizer randomzies items and nearly every transition between different rooms. Not included are:
    - Warps of any kind, including those entering dream areas
	- Trams and elevators
	- Transitions within Godhome and the Shrine of Believers
	- The transitions leading to Sly's storeroom, Bretta's basement, or to any trial of the colosseum
- The Connected-Area Room randomizer works similarly to Room randomizer, with the additional constraint that it attempts to keep rooms from the same area connected, up to a certain extent, and not affecting single entrance rooms.
Also, note the following:
- Due to an imbalance in the number of left and right transitions, the Divine and Grimm tents are included in the randomization, but their vanilla entrances have been removed, and will not spawn in Dirtmouth
- The nightmare lantern must be lit to obtain Grimmchild
- Sly must be rescued to use his shop
- Room randomization may take a long time, especially for the connected-area mode. Please be patient.

## New game mechanics
- The lifeblood door in Abyss opens with a single lifeblood mask in item/area randomizer, or is always open in room randomizer.
- Collecting Grimmchild activates the Nightmare Lantern
