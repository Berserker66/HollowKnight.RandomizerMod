# Randomizer

NEWEST UPDATE:

- Randomized the following items as "Dreamers": Lurien, Monomon, Herrah, World Sense (Black Egg Temple completion percentage pickup)
- The vanilla three dreamer locations require Dream Nail to collect their items
- Randomized all 16 mask shards as "Mask Shards"
- Randomized all 9 vessel fragments as "Vessel Fragments"
- Randomized all 6 pale ore as "Pale Ore"
- Randomized the 4 non-Salubra charm notches as "Charm notches." Due to a limitation, if you turn off the Salubra Notch QoL setting and randomize charm notches, her 4 charm notches will be lost.
- Grub items can now be previewed, and will display their grub cost
- New menu setting allows the player to selectively limit long locations.
- The hint system was altered to give hints specifically for items not collected. Due to a limitation, it may possibly skip items or give acquired items as hints if additive duplicates were acquired elsewhere. The hint system seeding was also altered to improve consistency in races.
- A glitch where Kingsoul fragments could despawn from the shop was fixed
- A glitch where visiting Godtuner could lead to the player having a negative simple key count was fixed. Now Godtuner subtracts a simple key automatically on collection, and cannot be previewed.
- Benches in Lower Tram, Ancient Basin, Deepnest, and Kingdom's Edge were altered to not set respawn if the player lacks the items to escape.
- Numerous other bug fixes


OLD CHANGES:

Randomization changes:

- Randomized the following items as "Keys/Items": City Crest, Lumafly Lantern, Tram Pass, Simple keys, Shopkeeper's Key, Elegant Key, Love Key, King's Brand, Godtuner, Collector's Map
- Randomized the following new items as "Charms": Lifeblood Core, Queen Fragment, King Fragment, Void Heart, Grimmchild
- New randomizer system allows compound item progression, such as three nail arts leading to a progression item at Nailmaster's Glory

Room changes:

- Lifeblood Core is now accessible when entering the previous room with any lifeblood masks
- The abyss climb sequence leading to Void Heart is removed. To compensate, the Void Heart pickup only appears if the player has Dream Nail.
- The glass jars in The Collector's room respawn, allowing multiple attempts to reach the item without Mantis Claw.
- Godhome is accessible with only Godtuner and Dream Nail. The item pickup requires a Simple Key, however.
- The dark hallway between Crossroads and Crystal Peak now requires Lantern to traverse, except when keys are not randomized. On easy mode with keys unrandomized, the player begins with Lantern.

QOL changes:

- Added menu toggles to add and remove item pools from randomization
- Added menu toggle to control how long items (presently Grubberfly's Elegy and King Fragment) are randomized
- Added hint shop in Jiji's Hut
- Added 1500 geo pickup in Pleasure House


TODO:

Randomize the following:

- Rancid Eggs and Relics
