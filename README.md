# Randomizer

NEWEST UPDATE:

- Added randomization for all Rancid Eggs, Wanderers Journals, Hallownest Seals, Kings Idols, and Arcane Eggs
- Jiji now gives 3 hints per rancid egg. With rare exceptions, Jiji will not repeat a past hint, or a hint for an item already obtained
- The randomization penalty against placing Mantis Claw, Monarch Wings, Mothwing Cloak, Shade Cloak, Dream Nail, or Dream Gate has been removed

OLD CHANGES:

Randomization changes:

- Randomized the following items as "Keys/Items": City Crest, Lumafly Lantern, Tram Pass, Simple keys, Shopkeeper's Key, Elegant Key, Love Key, King's Brand, Godtuner, Collector's Map
- Randomized the following new items as "Charms": Lifeblood Core, Queen Fragment, King Fragment, Void Heart, Grimmchild
- Randomized the following items as "Dreamers": Lurien, Monomon, Herrah, World Sense (Black Egg Temple completion percentage pickup)
- Randomized all 16 mask shards as "Mask Shards"
- Randomized all 9 vessel fragments as "Vessel Fragments"
- Randomized all 6 pale ore as "Pale Ore"
- Randomized the 4 non-Salubra charm notches as "Charm notches." Due to a limitation, if you turn off the Salubra Notch QoL setting and randomize charm notches, her 4 charm notches will be lost.
- New randomizer system allows compound item progression, such as three nail arts leading to a progression item at Nailmaster's Glory

Room changes:

- Lifeblood Core is now accessible when entering the previous room with any lifeblood masks
- The abyss climb sequence leading to Void Heart is removed. To compensate, the Void Heart pickup only appears if the player has Dream Nail.
- The glass jars in The Collector's room respawn, allowing multiple attempts to reach the item without Mantis Claw.
- Godhome is accessible with only Godtuner and Dream Nail. The item pickup requires a Simple Key, however.
- The dark hallway between Crossroads and Crystal Peak now requires Lantern to traverse, except when keys are not randomized. On easy mode with keys unrandomized, the player begins with Lantern.
- The vanilla three dreamer locations require Dream Nail to collect their items
- Grub items can now be previewed, and will display their grub cost

QOL changes:

- Added menu toggles to add and remove item pools from randomization
- Added menu setting to allow the player to selectively limit long locations.
- Added hint shop in Jiji's Hut
- Added 1500 geo pickup in Pleasure House
