# Randomizer

Randomization changes:

- Randomized the following items as "Keys/Items": City Crest, Lumafly Lantern, Tram Pass, Simple keys, Shopkeeper's Key, Elegant Key, Love Key, King's Brand, Godtuner, Collector's Map
- Randomized the following new items as "Charms": Lifeblood Core, Queen Fragment, King Fragment, Void Heart, Grimmchild
- New randomizer system allows compound item progression, such as three nail arts leading to a progression item at Nailmaster's Glory

Room changes:

- Lifeblood Core is now accessible when entering the previous room with any lifeblood masks
- The abyss climb sequence leading to Void Heart is removed. To compensate, the Void Heart pickup only appears if the player has Dream Nail.
- The glass jars in The Collector's room respawn, allowing multiple attempts to reach the item without Mantis Claw.
- Godhome is accessible with only Godtuner and Dream Nail. The item pickup requires a Simple Key, however.


QOL changes:

- Added menu toggles to add and remove item pools from randomization
- Added menu toggle to control how long items (presently Grubberfly's Elegy and King Fragment) are randomized
- Added hint shop in Jiji's Hut
- Added 1500 geo pickup in Pleasure House


TODO list:

Randomize the following:

- Mask Shards, Vessel Fragments, Pale Ore, Charm Notches
- Rancid Eggs and Relics

Misc:

- Improve system handling long item locations
- Allow preview of Grub items analogous to existing feature for essence items
