- helper log grubs/essence
- dupe geo getting... duped
- dupe geo exception (in GeoCounter.AddGeo)

Done:
- server stability
- no longer spams items when connecting and instead correctly sends unconfirmed items
- server will now not consider items received until both a confirmation message is sent and the player's game is saved, to prevent items lost when crashing/alt+f4ing
- fix percent???
- show names of readied players on file create
- show names of players in spoiler log
